The purpose of this Practical assignment is to design and simulate a PI controller to improve the transient response of the light bulb that was modelled in the previous practical assignment. The design specifications were used to calculate parameters for a PI controller that would meet them. The specifications were met and yielded a system that improved on the system designed in the previous assignment.
